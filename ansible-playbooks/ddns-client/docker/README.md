# Docker Deployment

If running the playbook in a cron job directly on your host machine isn't an option (i.e macOS or Windows) you can instead run it inside a lightweight Docker container. The following assumes you already have Docker installed with the Compose extension.

## Dockerfile

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) sets up a minimal environment with Ansible, Python, `curl`, and `cron`.

## Entrypoint Script

The [entrypoint script](./entrypoint.sh):
* Automatically sets up Ansible in the container.
* Dynamically generates the playbook using environment variables (`ZONE`, `HOST`).
* Starts cron, running the playbook either once per minute or at a custom interval (`CRON_EXPRESSION`).

## Compose File

In the [compose file](./docker-compose.yml):

* `ZONE` is set to the domain (your DNS zone).
* `HOST` is the record name (the hostname that should be updated).
* `CRON_EXPRESSION` (optional) allows you to customize how often the playbook runs. By default, it runs every minute (`* * * * *`).
* The vault password file (`.ansible-vault-pass`) and UltraDNS credentials (`ultra_vault.yml`) are mounted as volumes, so the container can use them without storing sensitive information inside the image.

## Handling the Vault File

By default, the `.ansible-vault-pass` and `ultra_vault.yml` files must be created manually on the host machine before starting the container.

However, if you donâ€™t want to generate them outside the container, you can log into the container (once running) and create them from within:

```bash
docker exec -it ddns-updater /bin/sh
```

Then, inside the container, create and edit your vault file:

```bash
ansible-vault create /ansible/ultra_vault.yml
```

This approach allows you to manage everything inside the container without needing Ansible installed on the host system.

## Running

Ensure you're in a directory where your `docker-compose.yml`, `entrypoint.sh` and your Dockerfile are located, then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

To monitor the cron job execution in real-time:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```
